Hey There! This is a text based adventure that allows you to create a name for your character and make several decisions in their quest. 
How to play: After running the .exe file to open the game, you should be given a prompt asking what your name is. To begin playin type whatever you want your first name to be, hit the enter key, and repeat the previous 2 steps for your last name. From that point on you should be given a series of scenarios with prompts. Mostly prompts will require the input of a number and the  enter key. Through out the game there will be times when clicking any key will continue the scroll of dialogue or move onto the next prompt/scenario.
Known Bugs: Occasional miss inputs will have game continue without clicking on a proper response to the prompt given. This matter should be resolved shortly.
